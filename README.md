# Web APIs Challenge: Code Quiz

## Description

Becoming a full-stack web developer, will involve an assessment at some point, of one's abilities to address multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges.

The Web API challenge involved the building of a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. While the quiz does have a basic HTML layoput and CSS designing, the primary coding build has taken place through JavaScript.

The app involves a start function to generate multiple-choice questions. There is a time constraint to get the quiz completed. Wrong answers take away 10 seconds of time. Once the quiz is complete, the user can inital and submit their quiz.

What I learned most about from this challenge was the JavaScript functions and using them to apply HTML coding is very productive!


## Installation

Getting this project up and running included the following steps:
1. Creating a very basic HTML file with minimal divs and texting.
2. Creating a CSS file to implement some basic design elements.
3. Working on setting up the primary JavaScript vars as well as the functions structure.
4. Worked on getting the functions to work....one-by-one.
5. Once JavaScript was worked, I tweaked CSS styling.
